        <h1>Class Order</h1>
      <div>
          <ul>
              <li>This example shows that it doesnt matter what order you put the classes in on the element, but what does matter is the order of the classes in the style/css. 
                    The later class (closet to the bottom) will overwrite any css rules that it has in common with the classes before (above) it. </li>
              <li> In this example there are 3 classes in the style element that are written in the following order: blue-overline, red-underline, and blue-line-through.</li>
              <li>blue-overline and blue-line-through both set the color to blue and have a text-decoration rule but blue-overline is declared before red-underline and blue-line-through is declared after red-underline.</li>
              <li>As Shown in the the examples 1.1 and 1.2 since blue-overline is before red-underline the css rules that they have in common will be determined by red-underline</li>
              <li>As Shown in the the examples 2.1 and 2.2 since red-underline is before blue-line-through the css rules that they have in common will be determined by blue-line-through</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="red-underline blue-overline">Ex 1.1: Class Attr Order: 'red-underline, blue-overline'</h3>
